I support AECO industry professionals to deliver high quality, efficient and joyous places, spaces and infrastructure.

I help clients and management teams provide a sustainable business platform from which design can prosper by leveraging data, virtual design, technology and information analysis.

I advocate for collaborative work practices including methodologies for distributed teams to organise without requiring bricks, mortar or even an employer in Architecture and Software Engineering fields.
